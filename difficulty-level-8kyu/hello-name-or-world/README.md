Define a method `hello`  that `returns` "Hello, Name!" to a given `name`, or says Hello, World! if name is not given (or passed as an empty String). <br/>
Assuming that `name` is a `String` and it checks for user typos to return a name with a first capital letter (Xxxx).

Example:
```ruby
hello "john"   => "Hello, John!"
hello "aliCE"  => "Hello, Alice!"
hello          => "Hello, World!" # name not given
hello ""       => "Hello, World!" # name is an empty String
```
