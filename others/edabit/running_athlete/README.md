## Running Athlete 🏃

Guess the code from test cases.

### Examples
``` ruby
running_athlete(["run", "jump", "run", "jump", "run"], "_|_|_") ➞ "_|_|_"

running_athlete(["run", "jump", "run", "run", "run"], "_|_|_") ➞ "_|_/_"

running_athlete(["jump", "jump", "jump", "jump", "jump"], "_|_|_") ➞ "x|x|x"

running_athlete(["run", "run", "run", "run", "run"], "_|_|_") ➞ "_/_/_"
```
