## Positions of a substring in a string

<p align="justify">

Let us go through an example.
You have a string (here a short one): 
`s = "GCAGCaGCTGCgatggcggcgctgaggggtcttgggggctctaggccggccacctactgg"`, with only upper or lower cases letters A, C, G, T.

You want to find substrings in this string. <br/>
Each substring to find has a label. <br/>
The different substrings to find are given in a string of the following form:
```
Base = "Version xxxx

AaaI (XmaIII)                     CGGCCG 
AacI (BamHI)                      GGATCC 
AaeI                              GGATCC 
AagI (ClaI)                       ATCGAT
AarI                              CACCTGCNNNN
Acc38I (EcoRII)                   CCWGG
AceI (TseI)                       GCWGC"

```

Only the first lines of a Base are given here.

In first place you get a few lines of comments. Then in three columns: the labels of the substrings, in the second one - that can be empty - kind of comments, in the 3rd one the substring corresponding to the label.

Notice that other letters than A, C, G, T appear.

The conventions for these other letters follow:

```
R stands for G or A 
Y stands for C or T 
M stands for A or C 
K stands for G or T 
S stands for G or C 
W stands for A or T 
B stands for not A ie (C or G or T) 
D stands for not C ie (A or G or T) 
H stands for not G ie (A or C or T) 
V stands for not T ie (A or C or G) 
N stands for A or C or G or T

```

In the tests there are two different Bases called  `Base`  and  `Base1`  and two long strings:  `data`  and  `data1`.

Given a base  `base`  (Base or Base1), a string  `strng`  (which will be data or data1 or s of the example) and a query name  `query`  - e.g label "AceI" - the function  `get_pos`  will return:

-   the  _non-overlapping_  positions in  `strng`  where the  `query`  substring has been found.

In the previous example we will return  `"1 7"`  since the positions are numbered from 1 and not from 0.

### Explanation:

label  `"AceI"`  is the name of the substring  `"GCWGC"`  that can be written (see conventions above)  `"GCAGC"`  found at position  `1`  in  `s`  or  `"GCTGC"`  found at position  `7`.

### Particular cases

If  `query`  name doesn't exist in Base return:

`"This query name does not exist in given Base"`.

If  `query`  name exists but  `query`  is not found in  `strng`  return:

`"... is not in given string"`  (`...`  being the query argument).

### Examples:

```
get_pos(Base, str, "AceI") => "1 7"
get_pos(Base, str, "AaeI") => "AaeI is not in given string"
get_pos(Base, str, "XaeI") => "This query name does not exist in given Base"

```

### Notes

-   You can see other examples in the "Sample tests".
-   Translators are welcome for all languages, except for Ruby since the Bash random tests needing Ruby a Ruby reference solution is already there though not yet published.
